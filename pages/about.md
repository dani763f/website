# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I create project results based on empirical evidence, and believe that the best products are achieved when the end users are involved from ideation to testing. I always ask critical questions about processes, and strive to be innovative without always reinventing the wheel.
I am a flexible and curious person who always tries to deliver results that are good and useful for my colleagues and any end users I interact with.  
<br>
As a person, I am empathetic, curious and trusting and appreciate the good mood in an often busy everyday life. I quickly create good relationships and am a team player who believes that the team best achieves its goals through ongoing process optimization and dialogue.
