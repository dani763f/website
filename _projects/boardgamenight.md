## <center>Designing for physical spaces<center/>  
<br>
We live in a world where technology has soon found its way into every activity, event and 
experience. We use technology in our everyday life to organize, support, activate, engage and so 
much more. How these technologies are designed and shaped to either fit into our world, or 
disrupt it, is part of the designerâ€™s job.

## The Project  
The problem-area was defined during the UX specialization at ITU. The case revolved around finding an area of interest where structured leisure activities took place. We were then to examine the current situation and identify one or more existing issues, which we could then solve or assist in through a screen-based solution. The board game night at ITU was subsequently chosen as it was a readily availbe leisurely activity with easy access to testing and participants.  

## The Problem  
Through the data several problem areas were identified, which had the possibility 
to be improved through a screen-based solution. One particular issue seemed more prominent 
than the others: **The lack of facilitation and guidance at the event.** It was found that new participants 
would be hesitant and unsure about the customs and allowed actions at board game night. We also found the 
regular participants could benefit from additional guidance in regards to the board games themselves, and their mechanics.
