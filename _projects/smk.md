description: This project involved designing a personalized art profile system to facilitate the transition between the physical and digital experience at SMK (the National Gallery of Denmark). The system was tested with 10 participants, and their response was evaluated using a combination of satisfaction measures and qualitative interviews to assess the prototype's effectiveness in supporting the discovery of new, related artworks.

# Developing affirming digital solutions for the museum experience  
<br>
I had the opportunity to work with SMK (The national gallery of Denmark) on a project that aimed to investigate how digital experiences could enhance the transition between the physical and digital experience at SMK. This task was given to students at the ITU as part of the launch of SMK's new [API](https://www.smk.dk/en/article/smk-api/) that made it possible to access most of SMK's collection of artworks.

We took a research through design approach and used iterative development and evaluation of a technological prototype to gain insight into our target group and their needs. Our process followed the Double Diamond model, starting with initial hypotheses and a defined target audience and goals. Through observations and card mapping, we established our final design brief and research question, and created a desired experience map to identify potential challenges and touchpoints.

To validate our concept, we used a Wizard of Oz technique and roleplaying to simulate an SMS reply service and conduct interviews with a user selected to match the target group. The participant found the experience engaging and easy to use, and believed the concept would encourage both individual and social reflection.

In the second iteration, we focused on creating a more realistic prototype by developing a custom profile landing page and incorporating real data from the museum's API. We also aimed to include more filtering dimensions and make the navigation from the prototype to the museum's website more seamless.

We evaluated the prototype using a combination of satisfaction measures and qualitative interviews, and found that it supported the discovery of new related artworks and was well-suited to the target group. Based on the results of our testing, it is clear that there is potential for a personalized art profile system to enhance the transition between the physical and digital experience at a museum. Further testing at the museum itself is necessary to verify the findings of the project.

Overall, this project allowed me to apply my UX design skills in a real-world setting, and demonstrated my ability to conduct user research, create and iterate on prototypes, and evaluate the user experience.
