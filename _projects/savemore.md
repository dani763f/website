By employing concepts from behavioral economics, while conducting interviews and utilizing cultural probes to gauge and analyze the daily spendings of a group of participants it was shown that 50% of the participants underestimated their daily spendings.
In designing the prototype 3 key factors, both present in the existing research and collected data, were used to inform the design.

## <center>Inertia, Loss aversion and Present bias<center/>
<br>
#### Inertia  
People are generally better at not taking a stand, which has consequences for the "default settings" our society has. This is exemplified in a study in which the number of organ donors in EU member states is compared (Johnson & Goldstein, 2003). Here it is described how the difference between, for example, Germany and Austria is respectively 12% in Germany and 99.8% in Austria.  
#### Loss aversion  
Loss aversion describes the tendency for people to value loss significantly heavier than gains. Loss aversion affects savings because households quickly adjust to a certain level of disposable income. This means that saving quickly feels negative as it impacts the 'here and now', even though nothing is really lost.  
#### Presest bias  
Present bias describes people's tendency to overestimate their own motivation and effort with regards to the future. Studies show that people tend to make the healthy choice for the future. Most often, however, there is an immediate reward in the unhealthy choice in the present, which results in this being the most attractive thing when faced with the choice in a real situation.
