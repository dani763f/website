## <center>AURORA is a game aimed at people with "SAD"<center/>
<br>
When the winter season starts, many people find that their mood and energy levels drop. However, the transition from summer to winter is especially hard for people who suffer from **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)**. SAD can be described as a recurring, depression-like condition that occurs at the same time every year. The impact can be so severe that the symptoms can lead to suicidal thoughts and manic states.

The primary purpose of the game was to try and help these people by increasing their activity levels and get them outside more to get natural light. Inspiration for the project included nudging theory, gamification, behavioral design and ["the Hook"](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788). The projects conclusion was a presentation and feedback session held in the atrium at ITU.

# The Process
At the beginning of the design process, one may not necessarily be aware of the issues that may arise in a design situation. However, as one learns about and reflects on it, many possible directions emerge. The design process therefore involves many risks, as it forces one to experiment, push boundaries and possibly fail catastrophically. Thoughtfulness becomes an important skill for the designer who must go through this seemingly chaotic process. Since a design will always have aesthetic, ethical, political or ideological implications for those who use it, the designer is largely responsible for what he or she sends out into the world. The designer must reflect on why and for whom the design is being created.

The AURORA project was a prime example of the unpredictable and messy nature of the design process. Sometimes unforeseen challenges arise, forcing us to adapt. In this case, our initial goal was to investigate how children deal with the winter season or SAD. However, as we progressed through the inquiry phase, we discovered that our initial hypothesis was not supported by the empirical evidence we gathered. Despite our use of divergent thinking, we became stuck in the inquiry phase. As a result, we had to abandon our original hypothesis and pivot our focus towards new empirical data.
