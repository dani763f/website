## <center>AURORA is a game aimed at people with "SAD"<center/>
<br>
When the winter season starts, many people find that their mood and energy levels drop. However, the transition from summer to winter is especially hard for people who suffer from **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)**. SAD can be described as a recurring, depression-like condition that occurs at the same time every year. The impact can be so severe that the symptoms can lead to suicidal thoughts and manic states.

The primary purpose of the game was to try and help these people by increasing their activity levels and get them outside more to get natural light. Inspiration for the project included nudging theory, gamification, behavioral design and ["the Hook"](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788). The projects conclusion was a presentation and feedback session held in the atrium at ITU.

# The Process
At the beginning of the design process, one may not necessarily be aware of the issues that may arise in a design situation. However, as one learns about and reflects on it, many possible directions emerge. The design process therefore involves many risks, as it forces one to experiment, push boundaries and possibly fail catastrophically. Thoughtfulness becomes an important skill for the designer who must go through this seemingly chaotic process. Since a design will always have aesthetic, ethical, political or ideological implications for those who use it, the designer is largely responsible for what he or she sends out into the world. The designer must reflect on why and for whom the design is being created.

In the AURORA project, we started by investigating how children deal with the winter season or SAD, as we were curious if they had any reactions to the changing seasons. Throughout our design process, we have been continuously working with divergent thinking, as we wanted to let the empirical data guide us forward. However, this has resulted in us getting stuck in the inquiry phase at times because our empirical data did not provide relevant results in relation to the problem we had set out to work with. For example, we initially had a hypothesis that we would work with children's SAD symptoms. However, we had to abandon this idea and instead focus on new data collection, as the empirical data showed that there were no symptoms to talk about among the children.
