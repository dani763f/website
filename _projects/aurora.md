## <center>Aurora is a game aimed at people with "SAD".<center/>
<br>
When the winter season starts, many people find that their mood and energy levels drop. However, the transition from summer to winter is especially hard for people who suffer from **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)**. SAD can be described as a recurring, depression-like condition that occurs at the same time every year. The impact can be so severe that the symptoms can lead to suicidal thoughts and manic states.

The primary purpose of the game is to try to help these people increase their activity levels and get them outside more to get natural light. Inspiration for the project included nudging theory, gamification, behavioral design and ["the Hook"](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788). The projects conclusion was a presentation and feedback session held in the atrium at ITU.
